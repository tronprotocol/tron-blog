# Tron Daily

1. **[Consensus]** Define the interface function to create a new block in the Consensus Module. Implemented Block class for testing consensus (Defined the required fields in the block);

2. **[Wallet]** Modify the proto reference, used Google format to modify the code uploaded to GitHub. Complete the transaction signature and verification of the code;

3. **[Overall Structure]** Improved the test framework and used an exponential half-fold algorithm to describe the summary information of the local blocks. This method can use as less data as possible to describe the local node, meantime the much information as possible to synchronize with the remote block;
